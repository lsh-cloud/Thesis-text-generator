# Thesis text generator

Following tutorials by TensorFlow, this notebook shows how to create a text generator.  
The text generator model is trained using data from my PhD thesis. The PDF is retrieved from an online repository and then the data in prepared to be in a format suitable to be input into the model.
Unlike modern LLM the model used in this example does not use transformers but instead is a simple LSTM model. This projetc explored how effective simple, low cost models are at text generation.
